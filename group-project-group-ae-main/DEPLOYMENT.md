## How to run local version:

**cd** into the **cryptoapp** root folder and run **npm start**

## Continous Integration:

Throughout the development of the application the use of Discord was heavily used as a tool to coordinate our efforts and publish each members contributions in a collaborative manner. Weekly standups and regular meetings were held to discuss and implement our changes as needed which is the sole reason the team decided against creating branches but instead work more collaboratively so that whenever changes were made each member of the team would understand and better follow how the application was developing and how things worked in general. Using our approach we frequently merged our code changes into a central repository where builds and tests were run.
